					<h3 class="head">Why did you build Ryde?</h3>
					<p class="content">Ryde was built with the intention to make renting cars easier and cheaper for renters,
					     and to make money for people looking to rent their cars.
					    It gives users a wide selection of vehicles to rent at a good cost
					    and adds an untapped source of revenue for vehicle owners. It adds a factor of convenience beyond traditional means of car rental.
					    It also helps renters and businesses by reducing the overhead cost of renting out cars traditionally making it cheaper to use Ryde for everyone.

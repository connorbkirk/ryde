  <h2>What is Ryde?</h2>
  <p> Ryde is a car rental system built as a term project for CSCI 4300 Web Programming at the University of Georgia.
    We built Ryde to be an easy to use method to rent cars and rent out your cars.</p>

  <h3>What makes Ryde tick?</h3>
  <p> Ryde uses the following technologies:

      <li>Java Servlet for backend</li>
      <li>MySQL Database for storing information that users need</li>
      <li>HTML and Freemarker for the content displayed on each page</li>
      <li>CSS for the amazing style you see on each page</li>
      <li>Javascript in the form of jQuery and Ajax to make using Ryde easier</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>Why did you build Ryde?</h3>
  <p>Ryde was built with the intention to make renting cars easier and cheaper for renters,
     and to make money for people looking to rent their cars.
    It gives users a wide selection of vehicles to rent at a good cost
    and adds an untapped source of revenue for vehicle owners. It adds a factor of convenience beyond traditional means of car rental.
    It also helps renters and businesses by reducing the overhead cost of renting out cars traditionally making it cheaper to use Ryde for everyone.
